"""Declarative creative treatments and explicit shot plans for H3 prompts.

The data in this module is deliberately separated from the system prompt.  A
creative treatment is a secondary directorial lens: it may fill an unspecified
cinematic choice, but it never changes the authoritative story, creates a cut,
or grants permission to invent genre tropes.  Shot plans are user-authored edit
boundaries and are therefore parsed with a small, strict JSON schema.
